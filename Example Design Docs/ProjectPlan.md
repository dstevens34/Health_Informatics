# Project Plan

**Author**: Team24 - Yongchang Ma, Kirk Pastorian, Monica Maslowski and Fatima Riaz

## 1 Introduction

Team24 will develop SmoothieCart, an Android-based payment and rewards management system for smoothie carts. This application provides functionality for processing customer credit card payments and maintaining a purchase transaction history to recognize loyal customers.


## 2 Process Description

The application will be implemented using a simplified Unified Software Process having multiple phases and iterations throughout the applicationâ€™s design and implementation. Supporting documentation will be generated as part of this process. 


####**Software Design**

Each team member will develop an individual UML-based design that describes an architecture for addressing the client's application requirements.  The individual designs will be considered, compared, and critiqued by the team.  A collaborative  design implementing the application will then be discussed and refined leveraging the individual design contributions.

*Entrance criteria*: 

- Draft individual UML class diagrams - prepared by each team member

*Exit criteria*: 

- Team UML design for application - agreed upon by each team member 


####**Inception & Elaboration**

A set of project documents will be developed describing the design and implementation details of the application.  The project documents will be updated and refined throughout the initial application development phases.   

*Entrance criteria*: 

- Team UML design
 
- Application Requirements - based on Client description of required application functionality

- Documentation templates  - include project plan, vision document, use-case model, design document, test plan
		
		
*Exit criteria*: 

- Project plan - includes roles and phases agreed upon by team 
- Vision document - outlines the project requirements, features, scope, and limitations
- Use-case model - depicts functional requirements of the application 
- Supplementary Requirements document - outline non-functional requirements
- Design document - describes design considerations, architecture, class implementations, user interface
- Test plan - describes testing strategy and test cases	


####**Construction**
Details how team will develop, test, and deliver a working application from the documentation and specifications created in the Inception and Elaboration phase.  The final application will be tested and integration-ready on desired platform.
 
*Entrance criteria*: 
- Initial documentation from Inception and Elaboration Phase 

*Exit criteria*: 
- Revised documentation - includes refinements based on improved understanding of system requirements
- Traceability information - describes changes made to requirements and selected use cases 
- Initial test version of application - provides basic application functionality and user-experience (alpha / beta version)
- Test plan - describes test cases, acceptance criteria and expected results 
- User manual - describes application functionality and usage 
	

####**Transition**

Describes the process for addressing errors and issues associated with the application.  Sets forth maintenance procedures to perform bug-fixes and refinement of application functionality & UI.

*Entrance criteria*: 
- Test version of application
- Refined versions of documentation
	
*Exit criteria*: 
- Finalized version of application
- Finalized drafts of documentation
- Application deployment
